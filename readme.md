Promise
=======

This is a custom TypeScript implementation of the classic Promise object.
It adheres to [the Promise standards](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).

This class can be used with any TypeScript project that requires EcmaScript 5 (es5).
You should probably *not* keep it around when es6 is generally available though.
